title: "Setup Julia"
---

In this section, we are going to setup Julia on your on computer. There are several ways to accomplish this task. You can choose one of the following methods to get *Julia* and *Jupyter* installed on your local machine.

## Install Julia

### Official Julia Release

The latest Julia release can be found at [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Download the installer in respect of your operating system.

1. Download Julia installer: [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
2. Specific instructions for each platform: [https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/)

### jill with pip

If you have already installed *pip* (if not, try install pip [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)). [Jill](https://pypi.org/project/jill/) is a Julia installer for Linux, MacOS and Windows. Jill can be installed via pip. Use the following command to get jill installed 

``` bash
pip install jill
```

Then, use jill to install Julia

``` bash
jill install
```


## What is expected when Julia is successfully installed?

After getting Julia installed, click Julia app icon or type `julia` on cmd/terminal. The Julia REPL[^repl] will show up (@fig-julia-terminal).

## Install IJulia: an Julia package for connecting jupyter {#sec-ijulia}

[IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) is an interface that combines Julia and [Jupyter interactive environment](http://jupyter.org/). This interface can be installed with Julia package manager --- [Pkg.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl). The following steps show how to get IJulia installed. Noted that any registered packages[^pkg-register] can be installed via these steps.

1. Initiate Julia REPL
2. Install [IJUlia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl). The following two methods are equivalent.

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Use `Pkg.add`

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```

### Use Pkg interative environment

Type `]` (right square bracket on your keyboard) to initiate Pkg environment.

```julia
]
```

The Pkg mode in Julia REPL is a shortcut to manipulate the Julia environment. To futher install the package, type

```julia
add IJulia
```

:::

[^pkg-register]: Registered packages can be found on [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages)


### Get Started with Jupyter and Julia

Once [IJulia.jl is successfully installed]({#sec-ijulia), use the following command to initiate jupyter session (@fig-jupyter-front).

``` julia
using IJulia
jupyterlab()
```

### Done!

Congratulations! You have successfully get started with the Julia programming language. In the following session, we will go through Julia basics and SciML package. The hands-on sessions will require to use JupyterLab to run Julia sessions. The source code of hands-on session can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/stevengogogo/Julia-for-SciML/archive/refs/heads/hands-on.zip) or view on this website.

For further information, the Appendix includes advanced topics such as developer setup and other alternative platforms.
