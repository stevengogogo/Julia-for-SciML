## Outline

The presentation will give a short tour about essential ideas behind Julia. Though this tutorial put emphasis on the Scientific Machine Learning, Julia is designed for generic purpose

## What is Julia?

Julia is a high-level programming language that well suited for computational science. It supports Just-in-time (JIT) and multiple dispatch to create static 

## Why Julia is fast?



## Multiple Dispatch

``` {julia}
function multiply(a,b)
    return a*b
end
```

``` {julia}
@code_llvm multiply(1,2)
```
